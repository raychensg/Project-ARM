\section{War Council 2 \\ February 20, 2015}

\noindent \textbf{Discussion Topics:}
\begin{compactitem}
	\item 3D projector may require high-speed projector
	\item Leap Motion \& Solidworks
	\item Mechanical Arm
\end{compactitem}

\noindent \textbf{Design Matrix:}
\begin{center}
  \begin{tabular}{ c | c | c }
  	Projector & Arm & LeapCAD \\
    \hline
    Requres high-speed projector & Stability and accuracy & Working with Solidworks API\\
    Working with Solidworks API & Stepper motors & No hardware \\
    Stable projection surface & Goal: balancing and throwing & \\
  \end{tabular}
\end{center}

\noindent \textbf{Decision:}\\
\indent The holographic projector poses the problem of creating a good image while allowing for a reasonable refresh rate. This is a project that will require more funding and knowledge of optics to complete. We are removing this project from the list.\\
\\
\indent Using Leap-Motion to control CAD software could be a useful and interesting to develop. We could develop a deeper understanding of Solidworks and the Leap-Motion. However, the scope of this project is more suitable for a Hackathon. Therefore, we will shelve this project until a suitable occasion.\\
\\
\indent The mechanical arm can be applied to a large scope of tasks. Creating a mechanical arm with a focus on precision and stability makes it a particularly useful for machine learning and automation. In particular, three test cases stand out to us: writing letters on a whiteboard, balancing a hammer, and throwing a ball. By creating an accurate, quick, and stable arm, we establish a hardware platform upon which to experiment with machine learning.\\

\section{Design Brief \\ February 23, 2015}
\noindent \textbf{Modularity:}\\
\indent The mechanical arm will designed to be modular. Addition or extension of joints should be simple and uncumbersome, with exception of extra load from the weight of the additional joint. The parts of each joint should be as universal as possible, and support the specified selection of motors.\\

%   	Motor (STP-MTR-*) & Holding Torque (oz-in) & Weight (lb) \\

%     17048 & 83 & 0.7 \\
%     17060 & 115 & 0.9 \\

\section{Prototype Proposal \\ February 27, 2015}
\noindent \textbf{Purpose:}\\
\indent Fabricate an axial joint that is representive of all axial joints in the system. This joint is to be used for calibration and load testing, as well as system analysis.\\
\indent This joint should be able to balance a tilt sensor (\url{https://www.sparkfun.com/products/10313}).

\noindent \textbf{Deliverables:}
\begin{enumerate}
	\item Single axial joint with the following functionalities:
	\begin{compactitem}
		\item 270 degree rotation
		\item 10 lb-in of torque
		\item No noticable deflection under specified load
		\item Less than 1 degree of undetected backlash
		\item Full range of motion in under 0.5 seconds.
	\end{compactitem}
	\item A system to convert voltage detected from an Arduino to a graphic interface on laptop. It must have the following functionality
	\begin{compactitem}
		\item Plots desired sensory input on laptop screen in real time.
		\item Saves plots as files (either interface into MatLab or as images)
	\end{compactitem}
\end{enumerate}

\noindent \textbf{Deadline:}\\
March 9, 2015 --- Arduino to PC Sensory Plotter complete\\
March 16, 2015 --- Mechanical Axial Joint complete\\

\section{Mechanical Analysis}
\noindent \textbf{301 Box Beam:}\\
\indent For the prototype, each joint will be attached to a 3 inch by 3 inch by 0.125 inch thick box beam made of 6061-T6 Aluminum. For the purpose of finding the weakest point in the arm, stress analysis will be run on each possible point of failure.

For the box beam to deform noticably or reach the yield strength of aluminum, around 88500 in-lb of axial torque is required. Because this value is significantly higher than the maximum possible torque output of any mounted motor, it is safe to say that deformation of the box beam is not the most likely point of failure. The safety factor on this part is over 5000.

\section{Package Arrivals \\ March 5, 2015}
Both the Automation Direct motor and the McMaster Carr turntable have arrived. We will contact Plethora in San Francisco on Friday, March 7, regarding manufacturing of parts 101\_Motor\_Plate and 102\_Connector\_Plate.
